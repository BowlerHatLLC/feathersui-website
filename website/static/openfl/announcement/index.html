        <p>Feathers community,</p>
        <p>
          In the next couple of months, I will officially launch a crowdfunding
          campaign for an all new version of <strong>Feathers UI</strong> —
          rebuilt on <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> and
          <a href="https://openfl.org/">OpenFL</a>. If I already have your
          interest, <a href="../#signup">sign up right now</a> and you'll be
          among the first to hear when I launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feathers UI is an open source library of user interface components for
          creative projects — like games, interactive visualizations, and other
          rich experiences. With Feathers, you can target a wide range of
          devices, including phones, tablets and desktop computers... whether
          your work will be on the web or available from app stores. Combine
          hardware-accelerated graphics performance with maximum design
          flexibility to help your users explore new virtual worlds, discover
          unexpected insights when they see their data in new ways, and immerse
          themselves in interactive multimedia.
        </p>
        <p>
          With OpenFL and Haxe as a new foundation, developers that are already
          experienced with Feathers will find themselves in an environment that
          is both familiar and filled with many cool, new toys. The
          <a href="https://haxe.org/manual/introduction-what-is-haxe.html"
            >Haxe language</a
          >
          couldn't be easier for ActionScript developers to learn, and it also
          includes powerful, new features like
          <a href="https://haxe.org/manual/type-system-generic.html">generics</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://haxe.org/manual/lf-pattern-matching-introduction.html"
            >pattern matching</a
          >, and <a href="https://haxe.org/manual/macro.html">macros</a>.
          There's also a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries, including
          <a href="https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/"
            >the Haxelib package manager</a
          >. With <a href="https://openfl.org/">OpenFL</a>, not only can
          developers deploy to Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, but they also
          gain access to <em>Linux</em>, web browsers (without any plugins!),
          and <strong>game consoles</strong> like the Nintendo Switch,
          PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without the community that embraced Feathers to build some truly
          <em>incredible</em> apps and games, this project never would have
          succeeded. I want to make sure that developers continue to have the
          same kind of powerful (and fun) development platform going forward.
          OpenFL and Haxe are existing pieces of that puzzle, and I know that
          adding Feathers will reveal even more of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can imagine, running a crowdfunding campaign requires some
          serious planning and preparation.
          <a href="../#signup">Sign up for updates</a>, and you'll get the
          announcement in your inbox as soon as you can contribute to the future
          of Feathers UI. <em>Thank you, community.</em> You're an inspiration,
          and I'm excited to keep building Feathers and to help you realize your
          creative visions.
