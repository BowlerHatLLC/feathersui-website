    title: "Very short development times",
    content: `
I do not trust in any other tool to do 2D fast development considering that the UI has to be retina enabled, responsive and with transitions and animations to be programmed in very short development times.

    content: `
I started a professional tablet application based on Starling and Feathers, and these libraries save me a lot of time and pain in the development process. The app runs very smoothly on all platforms, including Android tablets, iPad, and Windows 8 Pro tablets. That's simply awesome.

I've built cross-platform mobile apps in AIR/Starling/Feathers for an enterprise of 20,000+ employees. Engineers, scientists all over the world are using it to great advantage and are extremely happy with it. The UI is snappy &amp; appealing, AIR SDK/ANEs provide access to native os/hardware features, and the application itself is easily customizable. Thank you for all your great work!

    title: "My client was really impressed",
    content: `
I really like how both Starling and Feathers have proven to be great platforms for non-gaming applications. From the beginning, I felt that if you can do games, you can do anything! My client was really impressed with the multi-platform performance of AIR / Starling / Feathers, so it wasn't hard to convince them to use these libraries. Thanks, Daniel and Josh. This app wouldn't have been possible without your awesome frameworks and support!
