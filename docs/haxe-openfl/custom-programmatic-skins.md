[`ProgrammaticSkin`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/skins/ProgrammaticSkin.html) may be used as a base class for drawing custom graphics to use as a skin for a [Feathers UI](/) component. While the framework provides a number of built-in skins with [common shapes](./shape-skins.md), like rectangles, circles, and ellipses, sometimes a design needs a more customize appearance with multiple borders, transparent overlays, or even animations.
