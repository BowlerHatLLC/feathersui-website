Sometimes, in order to translate from design to code, a container that renders a [data collection](./data-collections.md) (such as [`ListView`](./list-view.md) or [`GridView`](./grid-view.md)) needs more advanced capabilities for layout and styling than the built-in [`ItemRenderer`](./item-renderer.md) component provides. In those situations, you can create a _custom item renderer_ for the data container.

Custom item renderers may be any OpenFL display object, but typically, they are based on one of the core Feathers UI classes, such as [`LayoutGroup`](./layout-group.md).
