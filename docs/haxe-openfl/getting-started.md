## Staying Informed

The [Feathers UI blog](https://feathersui.com/blog/) is the official source for all announcements and updates about Feathers UI.

You can also follow [@feathersui](https://twitter.com/feathersui) on Twitter for updates and extras, but you won't miss anything essential if you only read the blog.

Not every feature or bug fix in Feathers UI updates deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the [CHANGELOG.md file in the Feathers UI repository](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathersui-openfl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
